% Guidelines by language feature

Rust provides a unique combination of language features, some new and some
old. This section gives guidance on when and how to use Rust's features, and
brings attention to some of the tradeoffs between different features.

Notably missing from this section is an in-depth discussion of Rust's pointer
types (both built-in and in the library). The topic of pointers is discussed at
length in a [separate section on ownership](../ownership/README.md).
