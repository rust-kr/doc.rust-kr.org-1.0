% Rust Documentation

Welcome to the Rust documentation! You can use the section headings above
to jump to any particular section.

# Getting Started

If you haven't seen Rust at all yet, the first thing you should read is the
introduction to [The Rust Programming Language](book/index.html). It'll give
you a good idea of what Rust is like.

The book provides a lengthy explanation of Rust, its syntax, and its
concepts. Upon completing the book, you'll be an intermediate Rust
developer, and will have a good grasp of the fundamental ideas behind
Rust.

[Rust By Example][rbe] was originally a community resource, but was then
donated to the Rust project. As the name implies, it teaches you Rust through a
series of small examples.

# Community & Getting Help

If you need help with something, or just want to talk about Rust with others,
there are a few places you can do that:

The Rust IRC channels on [irc.mozilla.org](http://irc.mozilla.org/) are the
fastest way to get help.
[`#rust`](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust) is
the general discussion channel, and you'll find people willing to help you with
any questions you may have.

There are also three specialty channels:
[`#rust-gamedev`](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-gamedev)
and
[`#rust-osdev`](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-osdev)
are for game development and operating system development, respectively.
There's also
[`#rust-internals`](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-internals), which is for discussion of the development of Rust itself.

You can also get help on [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust). Searching for your
problem might reveal someone who has asked it before!

There is an active [subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/rust) with lots of
discussion and news about Rust.

There is also a [user forum](http://users.rust-lang.org), for all
user-oriented discussion, and a [developer
forum](http://internals.rust-lang.org/), where the development of Rust
itself is discussed.

# Specification

Rust does not have an exact specification, but an effort to describe as much of
the language in as much detail as possible is in [the reference](reference.html).

# Tools

Rust is still a young language, so there isn't a ton of tooling yet, but the
tools we have are really nice.

[Cargo](http://crates.io) is Rust's package manager, and its website contains
lots of good documentation.

[`rustdoc`](book/documentation.html) is used to generate documentation for Rust code.

# FAQs

There are questions that are asked quite often, so we've made FAQs for them:

* [Language Design FAQ](complement-design-faq.html)
* [Language FAQ](complement-lang-faq.html)
* [Project FAQ](complement-project-faq.html)
* [How to submit a bug report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports)

# The Standard Library

We have [API documentation for the entire standard
library](std/index.html). There's a list of crates on the left with more
specific sections, or you can use the search bar at the top to search for
something if you know its name.

# The Error Index

If you encounter an error while compiling your code you may be able to look it
up in the [Rust Compiler Error Index](error-index.html).
