Sometimes, things just go wrong. It's important to have a plan for when the
inevitable happens. Rust has rich support for handling errors that may (let's
be honest: will) occur in your programs.

There are two main kinds of errors that can occur in your programs: failures,
and panics. Let's talk about the difference between the two, and then discuss
how to handle each. Then, we'll discuss upgrading failures to panics.

# Failure vs. Panic

Rust uses two terms to differentiate between two forms of error: failure, and
panic. A *failure* is an error that can be recovered from in some way. A
*panic* is an error that cannot be recovered from.

What do we mean by "recover"? Well, in most cases, the possibility of an error
is expected. For example, consider the `parse` function:

```ignore
"5".parse();
```

This method converts a string into another type. But because it's a string, you
can't be sure that the conversion actually works. For example, what should this
convert to?

```ignore
"hello5world".parse();
```

This won't work. So we know that this function will only work properly for some
inputs. It's expected behavior. We call this kind of error a *failure*.

On the other hand, sometimes, there are errors that are unexpected, or which
we cannot recover from. A classic example is an `assert!`:

```rust
# let x = 5;
assert!(x == 5);
```

We use `assert!` to declare that something is true. If it's not true, something
is very wrong. Wrong enough that we can't continue with things in the current
state. Another example is using the `unreachable!()` macro:

```{rust,ignore}
enum Event {
    NewRelease,
}

fn probability(_: &Event) -> f64 {
    // real implementation would be more complex, of course
    0.95
}

fn descriptive_probability(event: Event) -> &'static str {
    match probability(&event) {
        1.00 => "certain",
        0.00 => "impossible",
        0.00 ... 0.25 => "very unlikely",
        0.25 ... 0.50 => "unlikely",
        0.50 ... 0.75 => "likely",
        0.75 ... 1.00 => "very likely",
    }
}

fn main() {
    std::io::println(descriptive_probability(NewRelease));
}
```

This will give us an error:

```text
error: non-exhaustive patterns: `_` not covered [E0004]
```

While we know that we've covered all possible cases, Rust can't tell. It
doesn't know that probability is between 0.0 and 1.0. So we add another case:

```rust
use Event::NewRelease;

enum Event {
    NewRelease,
}

fn probability(_: &Event) -> f64 {
    // real implementation would be more complex, of course
    0.95
}

fn descriptive_probability(event: Event) -> &'static str {
    match probability(&event) {
        1.00 => "certain",
        0.00 => "impossible",
        0.00 ... 0.25 => "very unlikely",
        0.25 ... 0.50 => "unlikely",
        0.50 ... 0.75 => "likely",
        0.75 ... 1.00 => "very likely",
        _ => unreachable!()
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!("{}", descriptive_probability(NewRelease));
}
```

We shouldn't ever hit the `_` case, so we use the `unreachable!()` macro to
indicate this. `unreachable!()` gives a different kind of error than `Result`.
Rust calls these sorts of errors *panics*.

# Handling errors with `Option` and `Result`

The simplest way to indicate that a function may fail is to use the `Option<T>`
type. For example, the `find` method on strings attempts to find a pattern
in a string, and returns an `Option`:

```rust
let s = "foo";

assert_eq!(s.find('f'), Some(0));
assert_eq!(s.find('z'), None);
```


This is appropriate for the simplest of cases, but doesn't give us a lot of
information in the failure case. What if we wanted to know _why_ the function
failed? For this, we can use the `Result<T, E>` type. It looks like this:

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
   Ok(T),
   Err(E)
}
```

This enum is provided by Rust itself, so you don't need to define it to use it
in your code. The `Ok(T)` variant represents a success, and the `Err(E)` variant
represents a failure. Returning a `Result` instead of an `Option` is recommended
for all but the most trivial of situations.

Here's an example of using `Result`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Version { Version1, Version2 }

#[derive(Debug)]
enum ParseError { InvalidHeaderLength, InvalidVersion }

fn parse_version(header: &[u8]) -> Result<Version, ParseError> {
    if header.len() < 1 {
        return Err(ParseError::InvalidHeaderLength);
    }
    match header[0] {
        1 => Ok(Version::Version1),
        2 => Ok(Version::Version2),
        _ => Err(ParseError::InvalidVersion)
    }
}

let version = parse_version(&[1, 2, 3, 4]);
match version {
    Ok(v) => {
        println!("working with version: {:?}", v);
    }
    Err(e) => {
        println!("error parsing header: {:?}", e);
    }
}
```

This function makes use of an enum, `ParseError`, to enumerate the various
errors that can occur.

# Non-recoverable errors with `panic!`

In the case of an error that is unexpected and not recoverable, the `panic!`
macro will induce a panic. This will crash the current thread, and give an error:

```{rust,ignore}
panic!("boom");
```

gives

```text
thread '<main>' panicked at 'boom', hello.rs:2
```

when you run it.

Because these kinds of situations are relatively rare, use panics sparingly.

# Upgrading failures to panics

In certain circumstances, even though a function may fail, we may want to treat
it as a panic instead. For example, `io::stdin().read_line(&mut buffer)` returns
a `Result<usize>`, when there is an error reading the line. This allows us to
handle and possibly recover from error.

If we don't want to handle this error, and would rather just abort the program,
we can use the `unwrap()` method:

```{rust,ignore}
io::stdin().read_line(&mut buffer).unwrap();
```

`unwrap()` will `panic!` if the `Result` is `Err`. This basically says "Give
me the value, and if something goes wrong, just crash." This is less reliable
than matching the error and attempting to recover, but is also significantly
shorter. Sometimes, just crashing is appropriate.

There's another way of doing this that's a bit nicer than `unwrap()`:

```{rust,ignore}
let mut buffer = String::new();
let input = io::stdin().read_line(&mut buffer)
                       .ok()
                       .expect("Failed to read line");
```

`ok()` converts the `Result` into an `Option`, and `expect()` does the same
thing as `unwrap()`, but takes a message. This message is passed along to the
underlying `panic!`, providing a better error message if the code errors.

# Using `try!`

When writing code that calls many functions that return the `Result` type, the
error handling can be tedious. The `try!` macro hides some of the boilerplate
of propagating errors up the call stack.

It replaces this:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io;
use std::io::prelude::*;

struct Info {
    name: String,
    age: i32,
    rating: i32,
}

fn write_info(info: &Info) -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut file = File::create("my_best_friends.txt").unwrap();

    if let Err(e) = writeln!(&mut file, "name: {}", info.name) {
        return Err(e)
    }
    if let Err(e) = writeln!(&mut file, "age: {}", info.age) {
        return Err(e)
    }
    if let Err(e) = writeln!(&mut file, "rating: {}", info.rating) {
        return Err(e)
    }

    return Ok(());
}
```

With this:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io;
use std::io::prelude::*;

struct Info {
    name: String,
    age: i32,
    rating: i32,
}

fn write_info(info: &Info) -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut file = try!(File::create("my_best_friends.txt"));

    try!(writeln!(&mut file, "name: {}", info.name));
    try!(writeln!(&mut file, "age: {}", info.age));
    try!(writeln!(&mut file, "rating: {}", info.rating));

    return Ok(());
}
```

Wrapping an expression in `try!` will result in the unwrapped success (`Ok`)
value, unless the result is `Err`, in which case `Err` is returned early from
the enclosing function.

It's worth noting that you can only use `try!` from a function that returns a
`Result`, which means that you cannot use `try!` inside of `main()`, because
`main()` doesn't return anything.

`try!` makes use of [`From<Error>`](../std/convert/trait.From.html) to determine
what to return in the error case.
